    <h1>Bakso Tanpa Tepung</h1>
    <img src="../src/img/bakso.jpeg" alt="bakso">
    <p>Bakso is a popular Indonesian meatball dish, known for its hearty and comforting flavors. To make bakso, start by blending 500 grams of ground beef with 2 tablespoons of tapioca flour, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 egg, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a food processor until smooth. Form the mixture into small balls and drop them into boiling water. Once they float, simmer for another 5 minutes until fully cooked. For the broth, boil a liter of water with beef bones, a clove of garlic, a piece of ginger, and a dash of soy sauce, simmering for an hour to extract rich flavors. Serve the bakso meatballs in the broth, garnished with a sprinkle of fried shallots, sliced green onions, and a splash of sambal for a spicy kick. Enjoy with noodles or steamed rice for a satisfying meal.</p>
