    <h1>Mie Ayam Daging Tikus</h1>
    <img src="../src/img/mieayam.jpg" alt="mieayam">
    <p>Mie Ayam, or Indonesian chicken noodles, is a savory dish with flavorful toppings. Begin by preparing the chicken topping: saut√© 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 chopped shallot in a pan until fragrant, then add 300 grams of diced chicken thigh, and cook until browned. Add 2 tablespoons of sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, a teaspoon of oyster sauce, a pinch of salt, and a dash of white pepper, stirring well. Let it simmer for 10 minutes until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thick. Cook 200 grams of egg noodles until al dente, then drain and toss with a teaspoon of sesame oil. Assemble the dish by placing the noodles in a bowl, topping with the savory chicken mixture, and garnishing with sliced green onions and fried shallots. Serve with a side of blanched bok choy, and enjoy with a dash of sambal or a squeeze of lime for an added zest.</p>
