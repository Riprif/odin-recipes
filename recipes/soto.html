    <h1>Soto Pak Agus BK</h1>
    <img src="../src/img/soto.jpeg" alt="soto">
    <p>Soto is a traditional Indonesian soup known for its rich, aromatic broth and hearty ingredients. To prepare Soto Ayam (chicken soto), start by making the broth: boil 1 liter of water with 500 grams of chicken, 2 smashed lemongrass stalks, 4 kaffir lime leaves, and 2 bay leaves. Meanwhile, blend a spice paste using 4 cloves of garlic, 5 shallots, 2 candlenuts, 1 teaspoon of turmeric, 1 teaspoon of coriander seeds, and a small piece of galangal. Saut√© the paste in a bit of oil until fragrant, then add to the boiling broth. Let it simmer for 30 minutes, allowing the chicken to cook through and absorb the spices. Remove the chicken, shred it, and set aside. Strain the broth to remove any solids. To serve, place the shredded chicken in a bowl, pour the hot broth over it, and add toppings such as boiled eggs, bean sprouts, sliced cabbage, and fried shallots. Garnish with fresh lime wedges, chopped cilantro, and a drizzle of sambal for a spicy touch. Serve with steamed rice or vermicelli noodles for a comforting and aromatic meal.</p>
